V0.01 - January 22, 2013
=====
First full alpha version of the DCSS Forensics program.

Currently, this program will allow the user to run a python script to parse & compile their morgue files into an cvs output usable for import into Excel for pivots. (basic use, other uses are possible).

Reads in all *.txt files in a morgue directory. The PATH variable in the forensicsMain.py file points to the main crawl directory, NOT the morgue directory. 

Currently works for v0.11 and above (up to 0.12-a0 trunk). Has not been fully tested, but works on developer's current sample set.

Outputs the following variables into a csv file.
