v0.03b - February 19, 2013
======
Minor bugfix (wouldn't read files with no gold information)

Added a new HTML file dump with some basic info. Will be expanded in a future version.


v0.03 - February 19, 2013
=====
Many new features added!

gameInfo class: 
--End information extracted from hiscore
--datetime variable created for sorting games
--Kill info extracted
--Gold info retrieved
--Various visit information extracted
----Abyss visits, Pan visits, Pan levels visited, bazaar visits
----Zig visits, completed, deepest, levels visited

gameCollection class:
--Various report functions added
----ComboMatrix report functions
------gamesPlayedCombo
------comboMaxLevel
------comboGamesWon
----allGamesWonList
----overallStatsList
----recentNGames
----topNScores

automatic output of summarized gameCollection statistics into an html file!
-- New module implemented: forensicsHTML.py
---- Generates HTML code and outputs it into an html file that currently mimics the
----   format seen on the crawl online servers.
-- Three reports created: Overview, All games by score, All games recent first.

config.ini
-- Set variables to be used. Can be used to control some output.

.exe file support! Should (in theory) work. When run, reads the config.ini file and outputs three HTML files. Default path will run in the same directory as the morgue files (Might be a bit messy, but works for now)

Added error handling logic to skip files that can't be read instead of bombing out
Sprint / Defense games no longer loaded


v0.02 - February 6, 2013
=====
Reorgnized the imports / gameInfo into a gameCollection class
Added save/load functionality with the saveGameData(name) and loadGameData(name) functions
Game data now only loads and adds in new games found in the morgue directory
Configurations can now be found in the forensicsConfig.py file
Added Achievements module! Currently only three test achievements are included. More to be added in a future release.
topNScores currently implemented in an alpha version.


V0.01 - January 22, 2013
=====
First full alpha version of the DCSS Forensics program.

Currently, this program will allow the user to run a python script to parse & compile their morgue files into an cvs output usable for import into Excel for pivots. (basic use, other uses are possible).

Reads in all *.txt files in a morgue directory. The PATH variable in the forensicsMain.py file points to the main crawl directory, NOT the morgue directory. 

Currently works for v0.11 and above (up to 0.12-a0 trunk). Has not been fully tested, but works on developer's current sample set.

Outputs the following variables into a csv file.

Name
Version
Score
Title
Level
Species
Background
SpeciesShort
BackgroundShort
God
WinFlag
RealTime
TurnsTaken
NumRunes
DungeonLevel
